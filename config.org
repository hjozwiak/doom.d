#+title:  Doom Configuration
#+author:  Hunter Jozwiak

* Explanation
This is my personal Doom Emacs configuration, useful for those who want to use Doom Emacs and have it work (hopefully) with Emacspeak, which is a screenreader for Emacs.

** Getting Set Up
In order for things to work properly, you are going to need a few base utilities.
| Utility    | Description                                                                 |
| Emacs      | The text editor that serves as the basis for the rest of this configuration |
| Doom Emacs | The configuration framework for the stubborn Martian Hacker                 |
| Emacspeak | The screenreader that allows blind folks to use Emacs. |
| espeak | A speech synthesizer that Emacspeak will use to provide spoken output |
| tclx | Provides OS primitives for TCL |
| tcl | A scripting language that Emacspeak will uses |

* Getting the Packages
** Emacs, TCL and tclx
These packages should be available in your repository on Linux systems, so installing them should be fairly easy.
** espeak
As a matter of personal preference, I prefer to use espeak-ng instead of the classic espeak, though finding one such espeak should be fairly straightforward in your package manager.
** Doom Emacs
Getting Doom can be done by running the cloning script or by entering the following into your terminal session.
#+begin_src shell :tangle ./get-doom.sh :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash"
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
** Emacspeak
To install Emacspeak, you need to do a few more things. Start off by getting the repository:
#+begin_src  shell :tangle ./get-emacspeak.sh :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash"
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak ~/emacspeak
#+end_src
Now, cd into the directory and make the Emacspeak pacage itself and the espeak speech server:
#+begin_src  shell :tangle ./make-emacspeak.sh :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env bash"
cd ~/emacspeak
make && make espeak
#+end_src
And with that done, we should be ready to rock.
* Configuration Steps
** A Base Doom Configuration
Let's start off by getting an init.el file rolling, from which we will enable various Doom modules.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;; This file was generated by a tangle process; do not touch this, instead edit config.org
;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).
